# Drone-Management-System

The Drone Management System is a simple C++ program that allows users to manage a list of drones using a linked list data structure. The program provides options to add drones, display existing drones, and deploy drones.

## Features

- Add Drones: Users can add new drones to the system by entering their range, payload weight, and drone type.
- Display Drones: Users can view the information of all existing drones in the system.
- Deploy Drones: Users can delete all the drones from the system.

## Usage

1. Compile the code: Use a C++ compiler or IDE to compile the source code.

2. Run the program: Execute the compiled program to start the Drone Management System.

3. Menu Options:
   - 'A': Add a new drone to the system. Enter the range, payload weight, and drone type as prompted.
   - 'B': Display the information of all existing drones in the system.
   - 'C': Deploy all drones from the system.
   - 'D': Exit the program.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the Drone Management System.

## Customization

The program can be customized and expanded to include additional functionalities or improve existing features. You may modify the code to handle more complex drone attributes, implement search or sorting algorithms for the drone list, or integrate persistence to store drone data.
